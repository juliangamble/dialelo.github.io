Facebook suggest an architecture called Flux that fits with the React rendering model. In this article I will explore a way to manage state in JavaScript applications using React as their UI layer and recast Facebook's Flux conceptual framework using ideas from ClojureScript libraries like Om . Flux Flux's core idea is that data should flow in one direction . This makes reasoning about applications easier, dependencies between system components are well-defined and all state changes come from a \"single source of truth\", as they put it. In a nutshell: Views trigger Actions which are notified to Stores by a Dispatcher . Stores respond to actions modifying their state. Since views consume data from Stores and display it, Store updates trigger re-renders in the UI when needed. There are several things I dislike about Flux, namely: It complects state management and the bussiness logic for causing state changes. State is scattered through various stores which are apparently modular albeit they end up knowing about each other. The stores are coupled with the dispatching mechanism. From Stores to Global immutable state Instead of having multiple stores, I suggest Om's approach of having a global mutable reference to an immutable data structure. This way we model our application state as a succesion of immutable values, without modifying data in-place or rebinding variables to different values over time. This can be easily achieved using my atomo library and Facebook's immutable-js . The data structure contained in the global atom would be a map, which gives us the ability to split data into separate logical domains using keys. This approach doesn't try to hide the fact that separate logical domains tend to refer to each other, here is a contrived example of the shape of a music application state: // state.js import { fromJS } from \"immutable\" ; let initialState = fromJS ({ user : null , albums : [ { title : \"La Leyenda del Tiempo\" , artist : \"Camarón\" }, { title : \"Veneno\" , artist : \"Veneno\" } ], playlists : [ { name : \"Flamenco\" , tracks : [ { title : \"Nana del Caballo Grande\" , artist : \"Camarón\" , album : \"La Leyenda del Tiempo\" } ] } ] }); We can create the global mutable atom very easily from an immutable data structure: // state.js import atomo from \"atomo\" ; export const state = atomo . atom ( initialState ); Since atoms are observable and the immutable values they refer to share structure when creating a new, modified value out of them, we can serialize the states our application in a memory-efficient way: // history.js import { List } from \"immutable\" ; import { state } from \"./state\" ; const history = atomo . atom ( new List ()); state . addWatch ( function ( atom , oldValue , newValue ){ history . swap (( hs ) => hs . push ( oldValue )); }); This gives us the ability of time-travelling for free, it's trivial to implement undo/redo functionality on top of this state management strategy. If we were to serialize the succession of actions and their payload in the system we would be able to replay a user interaction with our application very easily, making regression testing as simple as feeding the aforementioned actions to the system and asserting that we end up with a consistent state. Cursors We don't want to be passing around all the state to every view. Views usually display a subset of the global state so we need the ability to focus on paths inside the global immutable state for making our views modular. Om solves this problem with an abstraction called Cursor , which lets us focus on a path of the global atom and offer the same API as atoms. This allows views to treat the substructure as their data source and even modify it with the same operations as the Atom. I wrote a simple implementation of this concept for using it with atoms and immutable data. We can derive a cursor from an atom or another cursor, allowing us to refine the path they point to: import kurtsore from \"kurtsore\" ; import { is } from \"immutable\" ; let cursor = kurtsore . cursor ( state ), albums = cursor . derive ( 'albums' ), playlists = cursor . derive ( 'playlists' ); is ( albums . deref (), state . deref (). get ( 'albums' ) ); //=> true is ( playlists . deref (), state . deref (). get ( 'playlists' ) ); //=> true Views We can create a cursor without a path for the top-level component, and refine it when passing it to sub-components. With this approach we can have modular views that represent a substructure of the global immutable state without knowing about the overall state. Since cursors save a snapshot of the state they point to when created and immutable data equality checks are blazing fast since they are just a reference comparison, they allow us to know whether a component should update and implement a very efficient shouldComponentUpdate . You can see an example in my react-kurtsore library and other open source libraries such as Omniscient . Here is an example of a component that displays a sub-component of the global state and passes refined cursors to its children: // views.js import React from \"react\" ; import { CursorPropsMixin } from \"react-kurtsore\" ; export const Album = React . createClass ({ mixins : [ CursorPropsMixin ], render (){ let album = this . props . album . deref (); return < li > { album . get ( 'artist' )} - { album . get ( 'title' )} < /li>; } }); export const Albums = React . createClass ({ mixins : [ CursorPropsMixin ], render (){ let albums = this . props . albums . deref (), cursors = albums . map (( a , idx ) => this . props . albums . derive ( idx )); return ( < ul > { cursors . map ( ( a , idx ) => < Album key = { idx } album = { a } /> )} < /ul> ); } }); Actions As in Flux, actions can be identified with unique and constant values. For this we can use strings or ES6 symbols. // constants.js export const ACTIONS = { LOG_IN : Symbol . for ( \"user:log-in\" ), LOG_IN_FAILED : Symbol . for ( \"user:log-in-failed\" ), LOG_OUT : Symbol . for ( \"user:log-out\" ) }; We represent actions as an immutable record with type and payload attributes, where the type is the identifier constant and the payload can be an arbitrary immutable value. // actions.js import immutable from \"immutable\" ; export const Action = immutable . Record ({ type : null , payload : null }); export function action ( type , payload ){ return new Action ({ type , payload }); }; Getting rid of the dispatcher Flux proposes the singleton Dispatcher coupled to stores for triggering state transitions. This introduces dependencies between stores, making them know about each other and the order the actions must be processed by each store. Dispatchers are also different from a pub-sub mechanism in that they fan-out every action that is triggered on them to all the stores. I instead suggest using CSP channels for the actions pub-sub mechanism, which you get with the js-csp library. The pub-sub system has a channel in which actions are published, and we can derive a publication from it. The publication takes the source channel and a function that extracts the \"topic\" of the messages put into the source channel. For ease of testing we can make the source channel configurable using an atom: // pubsub.js import atomo from \"atomo\" ; import csp from \"js-csp\" ; export const source = atomo . atom ( csp . chan ()); export function publication ( topicFn ){ return csp . operations . pub . publication ( source . deref (), topicFn ); }; export function publish ( msg ){ csp . putAsync ( source . deref (), msg ); }; The publication allows other components of the system to subscribe to a topic, providing a channel where the values that share the given topic will be put. We can subscribe to actions with the approach shown below: import csp from \"js-csp\" ; import pubsub from \"./pubsub\" ; import { ACTIONS } from \"./constants\" ; let userChan = csp . chan (), pub = pubsub . publication (( v ) => v . get ( \"type\" )); pub . sub ( ACTIONS . LOG_IN , userChan ); pub . sub ( ACTIONS . LOG_OUT , userChan ); csp . go ( function * (){ let action = yield userChan ; while ( action !== csp . CLOSED ) { let { type } = action ; if ( type === ACTIONS . LOG_IN ) { let user = action . get ( \"payload\" ); console . log ( user , \" just logged in.\" ) } else { console . log ( \"The user just logged out.\" ); } action = yield userChan ; } }); The userChan above is channel that will receive log-in and log-out actions published to the system; the generator passed to go will run indefinitely, listening for the actions that userChan receives and logging those events to the console. Note that the generator passed to go will only resume when userChan has values available, so it's safe to use a while loop inside it. Publishing actions Since some actions may require asynchronous computations to get the data they need and for the sake of decoupling views from the actions and the dispatch machinery, we encapsulate action triggering in high-level APIs that the views can consume. Flux calls this high-level APIs action creators. I suggest to encapsulate every action publication in one of these functions instead of publishing actions from the views themselves because it decouples views from the system's communication machinery. We also gain the benefit of testing views in isolation since we can interact with them and make sure they consume our high-level APIs in the way they are supposed to. // authentication.js import { ACTIONS } from \"./constants\" ; import { action } from \"./actions\" ; import pubsub from \"./pubsub\" ; import http from \"./http\" ; import { fromJS } from \"immutable\" ; export function tryLogIn ( username , password ){ http . post ( \"/login\" , { username , password }) . then (( user ) => pubsub . publish ( action ( ACTIONS . LOG_IN , fromJS ( user )))) . catch (( errors ) => pubsub . publish ( action ( ACTIONS . LOG_IN_FAILED , fromJS ( errors )))) }; export function logout ( username , password ){ pubsub . publish ( action ( ACTIONS . LOG_OUT )); }; Interpreting actions Having a pub-sub mechanism in place allows us to encapsulate state transitions into small pieces. These can listen for specific actions (or combinations of actions) on the pub-sub and affect the state accordingly, isolating bussines logic into modular and testable units I call effects . // effects.js import csp from \"js-csp\" ; import { ACTIONS } from \"./constants\" ; export function logIn ( publication , state ){ let loginChan = csp . chan (); publication . sub ( ACTIONS . LOG_IN , loginChan ); csp . go ( function * (){ let action = yield loginChan ; while ( action !== csp . CLOSED ) { let user = action . get ( \"payload\" ); state . swap (( st ) => st . set ( 'user' , user )) action = yield loginChan ; } }); return loginChan ; }; export function logOut ( publication , state ){ let logoutChan = csp . chan (); publication . sub ( ACTIONS . LOG_OUT , logoutChan ); csp . go ( function * (){ let action = yield logoutChan ; while ( action !== csp . CLOSED ) { state . swap (( st ) => st . remove ( 'user' )) action = yield logoutChan ; } }); return logoutChan ; }; We can test logIn and logOut effects in isolation inyecting a publication and an atom. Note that the logIn and logOut effects are started when calling them and return the channel they listen to, giving us the ability to shut them down closing the channel. If we group together a set of effects we could create a stateful object that allowed us to start and stop them at will. // effects.js class Effects { start ( publication , state ){ this . chans = [ logIn ( publication , state ), logOut ( publication , state ) ]; }, stop (){ this . chans . map (( ch ) => ch . close ()); } } export default new Effects (); Putting it all together With all of the above, here is an example of how the entry point of an application could look like: // main.js import React from \"react\" ; import { CursorPropsMixin } from \"react-kurtsore\" ; import { state } from \"./state\" ; import { Albums , Playlists } from \"./views\" ; import pubsub \"./pubsub\" ; import effects from \"./effects\" ; const App = React . createClass ({ mixins : [ CursorPropsMixin ], render (){ let state = this . props . state ; return ( < div > < Albums state = { state . derive ( 'albums' )} /> < Playlists state = { state . derive ( 'playlists' )} /> < /div> ); } }); function render ( state ){ React . render ( < App state = { state } /> , document . querySelector ( \"body\" )); }; ( function bootstrap (){ // View render ( kurtsore . cursor ( state )); state . addWatch (() => render ( kurtsore . cursor ( state ))); // Pub-sub let publication = pubsub . publication (( ac ) => ac . get ( \"type\" )); // Effects effects . start ( publication , state ); })(); Further reading The Future of JavaScript MVC Frameworks Time Travel ES6 Generators and CSP Taming the Asynchronous Beast with CSP Channels in JavaScript","title":"Application Architecture with React: rethinking Flux","tags":"JavaScript"}]}
